# Supabase
[globs]: ["**/*.{ts,tsx}"]
- **Always use Row Level Security (RLS)**
- Never expose secrets in client code
- Use service modules (`apps/builder/src/services/api/*`) for all database operations
- Use hooks for reactive queries (not direct Supabase calls in components)
- After mutations, fetch fresh row with .select().single()
- Separate toasts from logging; safe error serialization
