/* CSS Entry Point
 *
 * CSS Import Order (CRITICAL):
 * 1. @layer declaration (empty) - must be first
 * 2. @import statements - must come before any other rules
 * 3. All CSS rules are in imported files (no rules in this file)
 *
 * Layer Priority (later = higher):
 * dashboard < base < preview-system < components < shared-tokens < builder-system < utilities
 *
 * SOLUTION: All CSS rules moved to separate files that are @imported.
 * This allows proper @import ordering without the "must precede all other statements" error.
