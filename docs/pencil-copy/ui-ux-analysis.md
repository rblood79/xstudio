# Pencil UI/UX Analysis

This document summarizes observed Pencil desktop UI/UX behavior without copying
Pencil source code.

## Workbench Model

Pencil is organized as a dense editor, not a marketing-style app shell.

| Area | Observed role | Composition implication |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Canvas | Primary editing surface for drawing, selecting, dragging, resizing, zooming, and arranging nodes. | Keep canvas-first workflows; avoid forcing edits through inspector-only flows. |
| Left sidebar | Tabbed navigator for document structure and assets. | Layers, Slides, Components, and Libraries should remain quick-switchable. |
| Inspector | Selection-specific controls for component status, slot metadata, context, geometry, style, and export. | Inspector sections should be contextual and compact. |
| Toasts | Low-friction feedback for save/export/error/promise states. | Prefer non-blocking feedback for successful or recoverable actions. |
| Tool controls | Shape/text/frame/hand tools and settings. | Tool affordances should be keyboard-friendly and icon-led. |

## Primary Sidebar Tabs

Observed editor labels and behavior signatures show these major tabs:

| Tab | Purpose | UX notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Layers | Tree view of frames/groups/nodes with drag reorder, rename, visibility toggles, and selected-node sync. | Selection in the canvas and layer tree should stay bidirectional. |
| Slides | Frame-based presentation/export surface with ordered slide thumbnails. | Frames double as slide units; export uses selected/all slides. |
| Components | Reusable component browsing and insertion. | Reusable frame/ref graph is the component system. |
| Libraries | External or bundled component libraries. | Library contents should import as reusable design-system nodes, not as opaque code widgets. |
| Agent | Electron-only assistant surface when enabled. | Keep AI actions explicit and document-backed. |

## Canvas Interaction Patterns

| Pattern | Observed behavior | Required parity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Selection | Selection manager owns selected nodes and emits selection-change events. | Selection state should drive layers, inspector, and overlay state. |
| Drag and drop | Dragging may defer parent changes until drop, with layout-aware insertion index. | Avoid immediate destructive reparenting while pointer is still moving. |
| Zoom | Camera supports bounded zoom, zoom-to-bounds, zoom towards point, and fit-to-content. | Overlay strokes/handles must scale inversely with zoom. |
| Pan | Hand/space-like panning translates camera in world units. | Pointer deltas must divide by zoom. |
| Context menu | Context menu is intercepted at editor level. | Prevent browser-native context menu when operating inside canvas. |
| Undo/redo | Scenegraph mutations commit through undoable blocks. | Group one user intent into one history entry. |
| Rename | Layer tree rename is inline. | Preserve keyboard flow for rename/commit/abort. |
| Visibility | Layer rows expose enabled/visibility toggles. | Use lightweight row actions that do not resize the layer row. |

## Component UX Patterns

Pencil treats components as reusable scenegraph nodes.

| UX concept | File model | User-facing behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Create component | `reusable: true` on a frame-like node | Selected frame becomes a reusable component. |
| Component instance | `type: "ref"`, `ref: master-id` | Instance renders from master plus overrides. |
| Detach instance | Remove prototype/ref link while preserving visual result | User can break component inheritance. |
| Go to component | Navigate selection to the master node | Component metadata offers a master jump action. |
| Slot | `slot` on frame plus `descendants[slotId].children` on instance | Recommended child components can be appended into instance-local slots. |
| Context | `context` string on nodes | AI/editor can use node-local context text. |

## Component Archetypes In Bundled Libraries

The bundled documents show reusable component names clustered around these
archetypes:

| Archetype | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Buttons | Button variants, destructive/outline/secondary/ghost, icon buttons, large buttons. |
| Form controls | Input, textarea, select, combobox, checkbox, radio, switch, OTP input, search box. |
| Navigation | Sidebar, breadcrumbs, tabs, pagination, dropdown/menu. |
| Data display | Card, table, data table, row, cell, badge, list item, labels. |
| Feedback/overlay | Dialog, modal, tooltip, alert, progress. |
| Layout/content | Header, footer, content, section, container, accordion content. |
| Visual primitives | Icon, avatar, vector/path, marker, divider. |

Counts across the checked bundled samples were highest for form/data/navigation
names, which matches Pencil's design-system library focus rather than a generic
HTML element palette.

## Inspector UX

The inspector is contextual:

- Single selection shows name, component/instance status, slot controls, and
  context controls when relevant.
- Multi-selection collapses to shared actions and selection count.
- Component metadata actions are icon-led with titles/tooltips.
- Slot controls are only visible when the selected node can be a slot or is a
  slot instance.
- Context is an expandable text area, not a modal workflow.

## Preferences And Settings

Observed setting labels include:

| Setting | UX implication |
| --- | --- |
| Show pixel grid | Canvas display preferences are user-controlled. |
| Show frame names | Frame markers are optional. |
| Use scroll wheel to zoom | Navigation mode can be customized. |
| Invert zoom direction | Trackpad/mouse parity is configurable. |
| Hide sidebar when Layers are open | Editor chrome can respond to workflow mode. |

## Feedback UX

Pencil uses toast-like feedback for operations such as export and errors.
Composition should prefer:

- Non-blocking success/error toasts.
- Specific error copy for failed export/load/import actions.
- Loading state that can be replaced by success/error.
- No blocking dialogs for routine confirmations unless data loss is involved.
