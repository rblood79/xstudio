# React / RAC Instructions
- Use RAC with accessibility (roles/aria/keyboard).
- tv() outputs **semantic class names only** (e.g., primary, outline, sm); no Tailwind utilities in components.
- New component deliverables: .tsx + .stories.tsx + .test.tsx.
- TanStack Table editors: split input, validation, and state concerns.
